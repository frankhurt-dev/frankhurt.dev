                Digital Channel Marketing Manager
              </h3>
              <span class="experience__company"
                >2017 - 2023 | Schneider Electric</span
              ><br /><br />
              <p>
                As the Digital Channel Marketing Manager for the Andean region,
                I had the crucial responsibility of developing the marketing
                strategy for the electrician channel. Schneider Electric, a
                global firm with over â‚¬4bn in turnover from electricians and a
                network of 450k+ partners worldwide, relied on my expertise to
                define the annual plan, buyer persona, customer journey, and
                communication strategy.<br /><br />

                Under my leadership, we developed a unique electrician channel
                program that significantly enhanced customer loyalty. This
                involved careful planning, leading, and monitoring of
                recruitment and engagement campaigns across platforms such as
                social media, email marketing, and SEM. In addition, I validated
                key performance indicators, assisted in the creation of new
                content, and controlled our budget to ensure we achieved our
                marketing objectives.<br /><br />

                My role also required me to coordinate online events such as
                webinars and trainings, which strengthened our relationships
                with distributors, retailers, and partners and further aligned
                our efforts with the sales objectives. I supported sales and
                product managers to optimize results through online marketing
                strategies and spearheaded the development and deployment of new
                mySchneider services. A significant part of this involved
                maximizing lead generation through the deployment of mySchneider
                Opportunities.<br /><br />

                It was paramount that I ensured all plans complied with brand
                guidelines, privacy, and compliance policies. I regularly
                reported results and presented plans to both local and global
                stakeholders.<br /><br />

                My efforts led to the successful conduct of live webinars for
                audiences averaging 500 electricians per month, and the creation
                of a thriving community of over 10,000 electricians. We enrolled
                over 5,000 customers in an electrician loyalty program and
                increased our marketable contacts in our database by 37%. This
                translated into a 29% increase in electrician sell-out, and a
                substantial reduction in Customer Acquisition Cost of 85%.

              ><br /><br />
              <p>
                In my tenure as a PRM Champion at Schneider Electric, I
                successfully deployed the mySchneider Partner Program for
                Electricians and System Integrators across five Andean
                countries. This involved launching a range of new services for
                the Partner Program, including mySchneider Opportunities, Chat,
                Product Selector, Online Courses, Webinar Calendar, Support
                Cases, and Order Management.<br /><br />

                A notable achievement during this period was the capture of over
                3M EUR through the mySchneider Opportunities initiative. I also
                contributed to a significant increase in user engagement, with
                monthly active users rising by 55%.<br /><br />

                Behind the scenes, I was responsible for managing the program's
                content and updating the website. This involved regular usage of
                Salesforce, as well as HTML and CSS coding. In terms of
                marketing, I created compelling visual content for social media
                and email campaigns, utilizing tools such as Photoshop and
                Premiere.<br /><br />

                To ensure all initiatives were on track, I meticulously managed
                and tracked customer databases and metrics. This data-driven
                approach enabled me to monitor the program's effectiveness and
                make informed decisions for continuous improvement.

              <p>
                I began my career at Schneider Electric as a Technical Support
                Engineer, catering specifically to Spanish-speaking countries in
                South America. My primary role involved troubleshooting and
                resolving a myriad of technical issues associated with APC's
                product line, which spanned hardware, software, and networking
                components. Additionally, I managed merchandise authorization
                returns and created over 100 IT FAQs.<br /><br />

                My responsibilities went beyond troubleshooting. I actively
                participated in product development by offering valuable
                feedback on product functionality and suggesting improvements.
                Part of my role also involved training partners, channels, and
                new hires, as well as assisting in the development of training
                materials.<br /><br />

                Under my stewardship, I generated a substantial seven-figure sum
                in leads and prepared reports to monitor team assistance and
                adherence to schedules. Moreover, I spearheaded the deployment
                of bFS in Salesforce bFO for the customer care center, a task
                that was carried out seamlessly, improving SLA performance.

              <p>
                In our family business, I took an active role in designing,
                testing, and refining the electronic components of our hydraulic
                systems. This hands-on engineering experience greatly enhanced
                my practical skills and sharpened my ability to meet customer
                requirements effectively. I also served as a technical resource
                for our sales team, aiding in their understanding of the
                intricacies of our products.<br /><br />

                In addition to my design work, I was responsible for developing
                and maintaining our technical documentation. This included
                detailed specifications, insightful reports, and user-friendly
                manuals to ensure both precision and clarity in
                communication.<br /><br />

                I didn't limit my involvement to the design aspect only; I also
                participated in servicing and troubleshooting our hydraulic
                systems. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of our
                products' operation, which in turn, contributed to improving
                their overall performance.<br /><br />

                Quality assurance was another area where I made substantial
                contributions. I worked closely with the team to enforce quality
                control procedures, ensuring that our products consistently
                delivered efficiency and reliability.<br /><br />

                Innovation was a constant pursuit in our operations. I actively
                collaborated with the team to evaluate and integrate new
                technologies into our product lineup, keeping our offerings
                relevant and competitive in the dynamic market.

              <p>
                At Ford, I contributed significantly to a pivotal project that
                sought to digitize and optimize the car audit process. My role
                encompassed creating an exhaustive list of spare parts for each
                car model. This included curating high-resolution pictures,
                crafting detailed descriptions, and noting potential issues for
                each part.<br /><br />

                Utilizing Ford's proprietary software, I programmed the
                touch-sensitive areas of each component, linking these areas
                with the corresponding images and descriptions. This digital
                resource was then deployed on touchscreen-equipped terminals
                situated strategically along the production line. <br /><br />

                The result was a more streamlined process that upheld Ford's
                stringent quality standards. The digital transformation not only
                improved efficiency but also enhanced the accuracy of the audit
                process, further reinforcing Ford's commitment to quality and
                precision.
